# NYCMapping2021
The QGIS Map, QGIS Layer Base Files, and the OG Files for the Layering 

The QGIS File is 'QGIS Project.qgz'

The OG data and base data are mixed in the main file v. being folderized as they should have been - working on fixing - please reference to the OG data branch to see what is not needed to run 'QGIS Project.qgz'

Base Files for the Layers: storm_sewers_outfalls, community_gardens, school_gardens, 2_mile_encompassing_area, and foreverwild
